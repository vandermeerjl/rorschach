Overview

Rorschach is a application that allows you to create cool, symmetrical paint blob effect in the browser. Beware, it erases every 4 seconds! 

For this I created my own library jen.js which includes a paint function (to create the strokes) and a mirror function (to reflect the elements over a line of symmetry defined by the creator). Please use my library to create your own applications! Users can customize the stroke begin size, the end size, and even the colour. 

Cool projects like this and more can be found on my portfolio website at www.jennifervandermeer.ca!
